    AI Projects Collection
Welcome to my AI Projects Collection! This repository showcases three different projects that explore foundational AI and programming concepts using Python. Each project represents a unique approach to problem-solving, from rule-based decision-making to a strategic game AI with minimax.

Projects
1. Basic If-Else AI Decision Tree
This project demonstrates a simple AI using an if-else decision tree to make decisions based on specific conditions. An if-else decision tree is a rule-based structure where the AI follows a set of predefined conditions to reach a decision, making it perfect for smaller applications where rules are clear-cut.

Features:
Simple, rule-based decision-making using if-else statements.
Great for understanding branching logic and how conditions control AI behavior.
Example Use Case: In a game like Rock-Paper-Scissors, the AI could make choices based on the playerâ€™s move by following a series of if-else conditions.
2. Rule-Based Chatbot
This chatbot operates using rule-based responses, making it an excellent example of structured conversation flow. Rule-based chatbots rely on specific keywords or patterns to generate responses, making them ideal for handling predictable interactions, like answering FAQs.

Features:
Designed with if-else logic or decision trees to identify user inputs and generate appropriate responses.
Focuses on providing structured, predictable responses for specific inputs.
Applications: This chatbot model is perfect for customer service bots or any setting where the conversation flow can be anticipated and predefined.
3. Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI (Minimax Algorithm)
This project is an implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, featuring an AI opponent powered by the minimax algorithm. The AI is programmed to be unbeatable by exploring all possible moves and choosing the optimal one at each step, providing a perfect opponent for the player.

Features:
Utilizes the minimax algorithm, allowing the AI to evaluate moves recursively and select the best possible outcome.
Includes a simple text-based user interface for an interactive experience.
Demonstrates fundamental game theory concepts, like minimization and maximization, to make strategic decisions.
Learning Highlights:
Recursive programming and algorithmic thinking.
Applying game theory in real-world applications.
